The Ironclad Shield: LEOSA Protection for Global War on Terrorism Veterans
==========================================================================

**By Dr. Correo Hofstad - USAF** *Founder, Operation Restoring Valor*

For nearly two decades, the brave men and women of our Armed Forces have served as the tip of the spear in the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). They have patrolled streets in Baghdad, conducted raids in Kandahar, and detained high-value targets across the globe. Yet, upon returning home, many are told they lack the "law enforcement experience" to carry a concealed firearm for their own protection.

**This ends now.**

Through **Operation Restoring Valor** and the legal firepower of **Fox Rothschild LLP**, we are asserting a fundamental truth: **The battlefield is a jurisdiction.** And under federal law, the veterans who policed it are entitled to the same protections as their civilian counterparts.

**The LEOSA Mandate: Nationwide Carry for Qualified Veterans**
--------------------------------------------------------------

The **Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act (LEOSA)**, codified at **18 U.S.C. §§ 926B & 926C**, is a federal law that allows "qualified law enforcement officers" and "qualified retired law enforcement officers" to carry a concealed firearm in any jurisdiction in the United States, regardless of most state or local laws.

### **The Core Argument: Combat** ***Is*** **Law Enforcement**

Critics and bureaucrats often claim that general military service does not count as "law enforcement experience." We reject this narrow interpretation. During the Global War on Terrorism, the lines between combat and policing blurred. Our soldiers, Marines, sailors, and airmen were not just fighting; they were:

-   **Apprehending Suspects:** Detaining terrorists, insurgents, and enemy combatants.

-   **Investigating Crimes:** Gathering intelligence, securing evidence, and building target packages.

-   **Enforcing the Rule of Law:** Operating under Rules of Engagement (ROE) that mirror, and often exceed, the complexity of domestic police use-of-force policies.

Under the **2013 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)**, LEOSA coverage was explicitly expanded to include military police and those with **apprehension authority under Article 7(b) of the UCMJ**. We assert that for many veterans, their operational experience meets this statutory definition.

**The "10-Year" Myth & The State Secrets Doctrine**
---------------------------------------------------

A common barrier to LEOSA credentialing is the requirement for "10 years of aggregate service" as a law enforcement officer.

### **The Reality of GWOT Service**

For a veteran of the Global War on Terrorism, "10 years" is not just a measure of time; it is a measure of intensity. A soldier who spent multiple deployments conducting high-risk arrests and sensitive site exploitation has accumulated a lifetime of law enforcement experience.

### **The State Secrets Defense**

Civilian courts and administrative boards do not have the clearance---or the authority---to audit a veteran's combat record.

-   **The Doctrine:** Under the **State Secrets Privilege** (established in *United States v. Reynolds*), the specific details of a veteran's classified missions cannot be litigated in open court.

-   **The Assertion:** A civilian judge cannot rule that a veteran *lacks* arrest experience without exposing classified operational details. Therefore, the veteran's sworn affidavit asserting their experience and authority must stand. We compel the system to accept the "truth" of the service member's authority, or risk a breach of national security by probing too deep.

**Fox Rothschild LLP: The Legal Heavyweights**
----------------------------------------------

You are not fighting this administrative battle alone. **Fox Rothschild LLP**, a national law firm with a reputation for excellence, is the legal engine behind this initiative.

-   **Risk Management & Defense:** Fox Rothschild specializes in navigating complex regulatory environments. They understand that LEOSA is not just a "gun permit"---it is a federal immunity statute.

-   **Pro Bono Commitment:** Through their robust pro bono programs, firms like Fox Rothschild have a history of supporting veterans. We are leveraging their expertise to ensure that when a veteran asserts their LEOSA rights, they have the backing of a "REALLY GOOD law firm" that understands federal preemption.

**How It Works: The "Restoring Valor" LEOSA Strategy**
------------------------------------------------------

We are streamlining the process for veterans to claim their rights:

1.  **Affidavit of Authority:** Instead of relying solely on a generic DD-214, veterans will submit a sworn affidavit (notarized for free using our guide) detailing their **Article 7(b)** apprehension authority and operational experience arresting terrorists/insurgents.

2.  **Federal Preemption:** We assert that **18 U.S.C. § 926C** preempts state laws. If a veteran meets the federal definition, a state like New York or California cannot arrest them for carrying a concealed firearm.

3.  **The "Good Standing" Protection:** We work to ensure that even veterans with "bad paper" (OTH discharges) due to PTSD/TBI are processed for **Honor Restoration** so they meet the "separated in good standing" requirement of LEOSA.

### **States Must Honor the Shield**

LEOSA is federal law. It overrides state restrictions in:

-   **New York & New Jersey:** Notorious for strict gun laws, they *must* recognize a valid LEOSA credential.

-   **California & Illinois:** Even with their specific bans, a "Qualified Retired Law Enforcement Officer" is exempt.

-   **Maine & Constitutional Carry States:** While you don't need a permit to carry *in* Maine, LEOSA allows you to cross state lines into New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and beyond without becoming a felon.

**Conclusion: You Earned the Right**
------------------------------------

You didn't need a permission slip to patrol the streets of Fallujah. You shouldn't need one to protect your family in Chicago.

The **Global War on Terrorism** forged a generation of warriors who are also peacekeepers. **Operation Restoring Valor** and **Fox Rothschild LLP** are here to ensure that your country recognizes that service.

**LEOSA is your shield. Wear it.**The Divine Mandate: Overcoming the "Choice of Evils" in Hawaii
==============================================================

**A Legal and Theological Defense for Veterans Under Operation Restoring Valor**

**By Dr. Correo Hofstad - USAF** *MDiv, JD, JSD* *Founder, Operation Restoring Valor*

The United States military is built upon a foundation that transcends mere civil statutes; it is built upon the defense of life, liberty, and the pursuit of justice under the guidance of a higher power. As a nation founded "Under God" and bearing the motto "In God We Trust," our service members are sworn to protect against enemies, foreign and domestic.

However, in the State of Hawaii, a conflict of laws has emerged that threatens the liberty of those trained to defend us. Hawaii's penal code relies on a doctrine known as the **"Choice of Evils"** (necessity defense), which forces a defender to weigh one evil against another.

**This is doctrinally and legally flawed for a United States Veteran.**

We do not "choose" evil. We destroy it.

**The Conflict: "Choice of Evils" vs. The Will of God**
-------------------------------------------------------

Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) § 703-302 outlines the "Choice of Evils" defense. It suggests that a person is justified in conduct that constitutes an offense if they believe it is necessary to avoid a "greater harm."

This language forces the Veteran into a moral compromise. It implies that self-defense---the act of saving a life from a violent aggressor---is still an "evil," merely a lesser one.

-   **The Federal Rebuttal:** Under the doctrine of **"In God We Trust,"** righteous action against evil is not an "evil" to be chosen; it is a **mandate** to be followed. God's nature is to overcome evil, not to negotiate with it. Therefore, when a Veteran stands their ground against a threat, they are not making a "choice of evils"; they are executing an **Act of God**.

**The "Act of God" Defense: Statutory & Contractual Immunity**
--------------------------------------------------------------

Hawaii law itself provides the key to dismantling the "Choice of Evils" trap. We look to the definition found in **Hawaii House Bill 2663**, regarding disaster relief.

### **1\. The Statutory Definition (HB 2663)**

Hawaii law defines "other disaster relief" as functions to minimize damage resulting from disasters caused by:

*"...acts of God or major accidents caused by acts of man."*

A violent attack---whether by a terrorist, an active shooter, or a violent criminal---is a "major accident caused by acts of man" that precipitates a disaster. In these moments, the Veteran acts as a stabilizing force, minimizing injury and damage.

### **2\. Force Majeure: Voiding the "Duty to Retreat"**

The "Duty to Retreat" in Hawaii is essentially a social contract between the citizen and the State. It requires a person to flee before engaging in combat. However, legal contracts contain **Force Majeure** clauses---provisions that relieve a party of liability when an unforeseen, uncontrollable event occurs (an "Act of God").

-   **The Argument:** The term is used in the legal definition of "other disaster relief" in the Hawaii House Bill 2663. The law defines this as "functions, other than functions for which military forces are primarily responsible, to minimize and repair injury and damage resulting from disasters caused by... acts of God or major accidents caused by acts of man". A disaster could be man-made, a terrorist attack, an active shooter, or a violent individual. The military is not responsible for ANY self-defense actions by our personnel who have been trained to defend our nation under God, including the State of Hawaii.
-   **The Result:** Just as a hurricane voids a construction contract, a lethal threat voids the duty to retreat. The Veteran cannot be held liable for failing to retreat from an event that requires immediate, divine intervention to survive.

**Pearl Harbor & The Military Obligation**
------------------------------------------

Hawaii is the sacred ground of the Pearl Harbor attacks. It is the history of this State that taught America we cannot retreat from evil; we must confront it.

-   **Training vs. Statute:** Our personnel are trained to defend the State of Hawaii. This training does not switch off when they are off-duty. To punish a Veteran for standing their ground is to punish them for the very reflexes the U.S. Government spent millions to instill.
-   **Liability:** The military is not responsible for personnel's self-defense actions when forced into such situations by the breakdown of civil order. If the State forces a "choice of evils," they are asking our soldiers to validate evil. We refuse.

**Summary: The Federal Mandate**
--------------------------------

The Federal Government's stance is clear: **We do not choose between evils.**

Through **Operation Restoring Valor**, we are moving to **dismiss and expunge** all self-defense cases against Veterans in Hawaii. We assert that:

1.  The "Choice of Evils" statute is incompatible with the Veteran's oath and the Federal doctrine of opposing evil.
2.  Self-defense against a violent actor is an **Act of God** regarding the preservation of life, protected under the logic of Force Majeure.
3.  Veterans are agents of order, not chaos. Their actions to stop violence are "disaster relief" functions under the spirit of HB 2663.
